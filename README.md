# Bomb Timer

![Screenshot](Screenshot.jpg)

The bomb timer from the streams. One thing to note is that I never see it transparent like you do on the streams, 
it's just a webpage that's embedded as a transparent layer into the final OBS output.

**Usage**

```js
// User settings
var initialMinutes = 00;
var initialSeconds = 20;
var todayIsChristmas = true;
```

Modify these varibles in Bomb.html
